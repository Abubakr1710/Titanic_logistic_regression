    "In linear regression, we are predicting the continuous values but what if we want to predict categorical values like True or False , right or wrong, Yes or no so in that case our linear regression model doesnâ€™t work, so for solving this type of problem we have to use logistic regression. In logistic regression, we are playing with the probability(Chances of our output variable).\n",
